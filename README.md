## The challenge
The challenge is to predict patient FVC progressien given the patient's details (as in train.csv) with an initial FVC measurement and CT scans.

## How it work's
Every patient FVS is fitted with an exponent so: FVC(t) = Ie^-kt, where I is the initial FVC, t is time and k is the fitted expnential coefficiant.  
The model is a squeezenet mockup. It tries to predict the exponent coefficiant from the patiants CT scans.  
It does so by predicting k for every scan and then averaging over k's.
The predict.exponent_generator does just that. It itarates threw the dataset images partitioned per patient. It then predicts k per patient and yeilds the exponent
function and patient ID.

## Generating the exponent function
The exponent functions for training are generated by taking a training patient FVC history and fitting a linear function:  
ln(FVC) = -kt 

Before fitting the funcion, outlier FVC measurements were removed by cook's distance method.
Then k coefficiant is yielded and an exponenet function is built with the initial FVC measurement.

## Cloud Dataset
The CT scans and ground truth k per scan was uploaded to a GCS bucket after converting into TF Record format.
